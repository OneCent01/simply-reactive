## React

### Semantic Breakdown
Traditionally, components are divided into two categories: reusable components and views built from them. In the `react` folder you'll see I have two folders to contain these components, which I've decided to call components and systems. Calling the views 'systems' is a semantic choice, as not every system is its own view, but may be a subview (component) in a more complex view.
